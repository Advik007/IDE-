# IDEPlusPlus
With this advanced project in Machine Language Coding, I would like to present my latest project - as of 26th August 2019 - a    program where an experienced C - Language Coder, could successfully convert his/her code into C++.
<br>
As of today, we have a success rate of 99% with a failure rate of less than 1% in successful Code Conversion. This program focuses on the major aspects - especially in businesses - for converting code from C to C++.

## Updates
26th August 2019 :
- Successfully completed conversion of C to C++

## Applications of this Project
- Let's suppose two persons - Advik and Anurag - are working in an office. Their boss requires them to make an application. Advik seems to be experienced in C, but Anurag is confident and brimming in C++! How would they integrate their programme together, if both of them do not have sufficient knowledge in the other language?
That's where we come in! IDE++ helps in this process and suitably converts C to C++! This also supports the further integration of code in this program!

- C is **NOT** included in the Microsoft .NET Framework and hence, lacks several features! IDE++ helps in converted this C code to C++ which is **INDEED** included in the Microsoft .NET Framework. 

## Objectives/Aim of this Project
The main aim of our program is to convert written code from one language to another language. This converted code - even though not making sense to the visual eye -  have the exact same outputs!  This leads to the conclusion that can converted code and implement own code to make the required program. 

## KEYWORD TO KNOW TO UNDERSTAND THE MAKING OF THE PROGRAM
- **Source Code**: (High-level programming language) This is specifically designed by computer programmers, specify the actions to be performed to a computer.
- **Assembly Code**: An assembly language implements a symbolic representation of the machine code needed to program a given CPU architecture. These files are saved with the file extension,”.asm”.
- **Compiler**:  This is primarily used for programs that translates source code from a high-level programming language to a lower-level language. 
- **Database**:  Database is a systematic collection of data which supports storage and manipulation of data and  makes data management easy.
- **Inline Assembly Code**: A external to-be-added library, which can be used as a function, in C and C++ which allows assembly code to be placed appropriately in code and function as lines of code of C/C++.
- **GNU**: The GNU Compiler Collection is a compiler system produced by the GNU Project supporting various programming languages. In this project, we use GNU for compilers of C, C++ and Java.
  - **GCC**: C Code Compiler
