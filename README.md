# IDEPlusPlus
With this advanced project in Machine Language Coding, I would like to present my latest project - as of 26th August 2019 - a    program where an experienced C - Language Coder, could successfully convert his/her code into C++.
<br>
As of today, we have a success rate of 99% with a failure rate of less than 1% in successful Code Conversion. This program focuses on the major aspects - especially in businesses - for converting code from C to C++.

## Updates
26th August 2019 :
- Successfully completed conversion of C to C++

## Applications of this Project
- Let's suppose two persons - Advik and Anurag - are working in an office. Their boss requires them to make an application. Advik seems to be experienced in C, but Anurag is confident and brimming in C++! How would they integrate their programme together, if both of them do not have sufficient knowledge in the other language?
That's where we come in! IDE++ helps in this process and suitably converts C to C++! This also supports the further integration of code in this program!

- C is **NOT** included in the Microsoft .NET Framework and hence, lacks several features! IDE++ helps in converted this C code to C++ which is **INDEED** included in the Microsoft .NET Framework. 

## Objectives/Aim of this Project
The main aim of our program is to convert written code from one language to another language. This converted code - even though not making sense to the visual eye -  have the exact same outputs!  This leads to the conclusion that can converted code and implement own code to make the required program.
