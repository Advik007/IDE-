# IDEPlusPlus
With this advanced project in Machine Language Coding, I would like to present my latest project - as of 26th August 2019 - a    program where an experienced C - Language Coder, could successfully convert his/her code into C++.
<br>
As of today, we have a success rate of 99% with a failure rate of less than 1% in successful Code Conversion. This program focuses on the major aspects - especially in businesses - for converting code from C to C++.

## Updates
26th August 2019 :
- Successfully completed conversion of C to C++

## Applications of this Project
- Let's suppose two persons - Advik and Anurag - are working in an office. Their boss requires them to make an application. Advik seems to be experienced in C, but Anurag is confident and brimming in C++! How would they integrate their programme together, if both of them do not have sufficient knowledge in the other language?
That's where we come in! IDE++ helps in this process and suitably converts C to C++! This also supports the further integration of code in this program!

- C is **NOT** included in the Microsoft .NET Framework and hence, lacks several features! IDE++ helps in converted this C code to C++ which is **INDEED** included in the Microsoft .NET Framework. 

## Objectives/Aim of this Project
The main aim of our program is to convert written code from one language to another language. This converted code - even though not making sense to the visual eye -  have the exact same outputs!  This leads to the conclusion that can converted code and implement own code to make the required program. 

## Keywords
- **Source Code**: (High-level programming language) This is specifically designed by computer programmers, specify the actions to be performed to a computer.
- **Assembly Code**: An assembly language implements a symbolic representation of the machine code needed to program a given CPU architecture. These files are saved with the file extension,”.asm”.
- **Compiler**:  This is primarily used for programs that translates source code from a high-level programming language to a lower-level language. 
- **Database**:  Database is a systematic collection of data which supports storage and manipulation of data and  makes data management easy.
- **Inline Assembly Code**: A external to-be-added library, which can be used as a function, in C and C++ which allows assembly code to be placed appropriately in code and function as lines of code of C/C++.
- **GNU**: The GNU Compiler Collection is a compiler system produced by the GNU Project supporting various programming languages. In this project, we use GNU for compilers of C, C++ and Java.
  1. **GCC**: C Code Compiler

## Command Prompt's Significance
In this program, we hold Command Prompt ***CMD*** with a very huge significance. It helps us run several executions in our Application. As a result, I would be discussing a few commands in CMD with you to make you fully understand our program. 

# Wiki
We would be talking about several key factors in detail to explain the working of the program.
- **Contents to be Covered:**
  1. Compilation
  2. Prerequites
  3. Functions in CMD
  4. Assembly Code Conversion

## I. Compilation
We are using **CMD** to compile programs. 

***NOTE:** IDE++ does not run if compiler errors are present in the program.* 
<br>
Even such so, we use GCC (C Code Compiler & Debugger) to successfully compile the project! In the IIIrd section, we will be using *CMD* to compile the C code.

## II. Prerequites
- For this to work, we need to conduct several steps:
  1. Downloading
  2. Installation
  3. System Variables
  
# i. Downloading
- Open [MinGW website](http://www.mingw.org).
